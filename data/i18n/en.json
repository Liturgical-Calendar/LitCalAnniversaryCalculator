He is remembered on January 22 in the Hieronymian Martyrology (5th-6th century). With the advent of Emperor Constantine, who had converted to Christianity, a basilica was erected in Valencia in honor of St. Vincent and his relics were composed under the main altar. However, following the invasion of the Moors, the Christians of Valencia stole the body of the Martyr to put it in safety in Portugal, in a specially built church on the promontory now known as Cape San Vincenzo. After the war against the Moors, the remains were embarked on a ship that headed for Lisbon. A devotional legend tells that during the voyage some crows alighted on the prow and stern of this ship as if to signify their renewed protection to the holy martyr whom they had already saved from the wild beasts one day. Once in the city, the body was placed in the church of Santa Giusta and Santa Rufina and after some time, on 15 September 1173, solemnly transported to the cathedral.

Buonfiglio of Florence (Monaldi), according to tradition the first of the seven and their leader; prior of Montesenario on March 17, 1250, when the bishop of Siena Buonfiglio granted permission for the construction of the church and convent of Santa Maria di Cafaggio in the city, now the basilica of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. In 1251-1252 he also lived in Cafaggio, where he received the young Filippo Benizi into the Order. He died, according to tradition, on January 1, 1262 and was buried at Montesenario. Amadio of Florence (Amidei), who seems to have spent his entire life in the Montesenario convent. Tradition has it that, at his death in 1266, all the Fathers saw a flame of fire rise high, a sign and symbol of his love for God, as indicated by his name. Manetto of Florence (dell'Antella), prior of the Lucca convent in 1264, was elected General of the Order in 1265. He resigned from the generalate in 1267 and was succeeded by Filippo Benizi. Uguccione of Florence (Uguccioni), perhaps prior of Montesenario in 1259, from a family in Città di Castello on August 21, 1255, and companion of Sostegno and Filippo when, according to the Legenda B. Philippi from the 14th century, the latter healed a poor leper. He died in 1282, at Montesenario, after returning from the general chapter of Viterbo, on the same day and at the same time as his friend Sostegno. Sostegno of Florence (Sostegni), also mentioned in the Legenda de Origine as the uncle of Fra Lapo of Florence (28); perhaps vicar general in France. He died in 1282 (see above) and was buried together with the other founders at Montesenario. Alessio Falconieri, the most well-known of the seven saints. Humble, desiring penance, even in old age he dedicated himself to manual labor and seeking alms (house by house), despite the discomforts of age and season (Legenda de Origine). He protected the young members of the Order and used the money from the vestments that were due to him (a custom of the Servites) to send the most deserving of them to study at the Sorbonne in Paris. He lived to almost 110 years and died in 1310.",

This community was the origin of the Order of Carmelites and many lay brotherhoods that spread the worship of the Virgin of Carmel (or of Carmine). The Carmelite Order began to celebrate the feast dedicated to the Blessed Virgin \"of Mount Carmel\" in England from the second half of the 1300s every July 17, in reference to the date of the last session of the Council of Lyon (1274), in which the Order received an approval that saved it from suppression; it was established with the purpose of thanking the Virgin Mary for all the benefits granted to the Order, as protector and advocate. Later, especially in the 16th century, primary importance was given to the Scapular, which became the most immediate reason to thank and affirm one's love for the Mother of God. Therefore, its celebration was moved forward to July 16, in reference to the day on which, according to tradition, the Madonna would have appeared to Saint Simon Stock giving him the Scapular (1251).[18] This recurrence will quickly spread throughout the world, to the point that - in the apostolic exhortation \"Marialis Cultus\" - Pope Paul VI lists it among the feasts \"originally celebrated by particular religious families, but which today, due to their widespread reach, can truly be said to be ecclesial\".",

Her memory is indicated on July 22 in the Martyrology of Bede (8th century). Pope Francis elevated the memory to the rank of feast on June 3, 2016 to underline her unique role as the first witness of the resurrection and \"apostle of the apostles\" (Preface). As a Catholic saint, the relics of Mary Magdalene were venerated at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, Provence, attracting such a crowd of pilgrims that a large basilica was erected in the middle of the 13th century, one of the most famous Gothic churches in southern France. The discovery of the relics is attributed to Charles II of Anjou, known as \"the lame\", made in 1279. The relics were validated by Pope Boniface VIII in 1295 and kept in the basilica of Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. Although her bones were scattered during the French Revolution, it was said that her head remained in her shrine in a cave at La Sainte-Baume near Marseille, where the saint would have retired; there are also stories of great miracles and blessings received by those who went to the shrine to venerate Magdalene. The saint's foot, kept in a precious reliquary of the circle of Benvenuto Cellini has been venerated for centuries in Rome in a chapel located at the entrance of Ponte Sant'Angelo last of the major relics before reaching the tomb of Saint Peter.

During his convalescence, reading the life of Christ and some saints marked the beginning of his conversion for him. A long journey led him through a period of spiritual discernment and a prolonged season of philosophical and theological studies, culminating in Paris. Here a group of companions formed around him, with whom he presented himself to Pope Paul III. They exposed their ideal to him: defense and propagation of the faith and absolute availability to the Roman Pontiff regarding any mission he wanted to entrust to them for the missionary expansion of the Gospel and the reform of the Church. The spirituality of the Society of Jesus has its cornerstone in the Spiritual Exercises, which summarize Ignatius's inner experience. Pope Gregory XV enrolled him among the saints in 1622.",

        "notes": "Augustine (Tagaste, now Souk Ahras, Algeria, November 13, 354 - Hippo, now Annaba, August 28, 430), of a pagan father and Christian mother, was introduced to literary studies. After a period of youthful disorientation, he began a passionate search for truth, adhering to a Manichean form of Christianity. A professor of rhetoric in Milan, he met Saint Ambrose, whose preaching he listened to and from whom he received Baptism. Returning to Africa and elected bishop of Hippo, he lived with his own clergy in a monastic-type community; the rule he composed will become a reference text for many institutes of consecrated life in the West. To the exercise of the ministry, particularly preaching, he combined a constant commitment to deepening and defending the faith, producing a corpus of works of such breadth and depth as to constitute one of the most fruitful legacies of the ancient Christian tradition. His mortal remains are most likely deposited in the cathedral known as \"Basilica Pacis\" and jealously guarded by the Christians of Hippo as Possidius, his first biographer, tells in the life he lovingly wrote and of which we currently (since 1955) have a critical edition, due to the professor of Christian literature, today Card. Michael Pilgrim (Augustine Trapè, Bibliotheca Sanctorum, vol. 1, col. 433). Later, the body of St. Augustine was transferred from Hippo to Sardinia and from Sardinia to Pavia, where it still rests. So even the bones of the Holy Bishop have had their ordeal! These two transfers are very certain and differently documented, by various authors. It is more difficult to document the two relative dates and the particular circumstances.",

        "notes": "Devotion to the Our Lady of Sorrows greatly developed in the last centuries of the Middle Ages, expressing itself both in religious poetry (Stabat Mater), and in the depiction of the Pieta. The liturgical memory was introduced by Pius VII in 1814, also in reference to the troubles suffered by the Church in those years. Through her intimate union with the Son, Mary's motherhood extends to all humanity redeemed by Christ on the cross (cf. Jn 19, 25-27). Devotion to the Our Lady of Sorrows developed from the end of the 11th century, with an early mention of celebrations of her 5 joys and her five sorrows, symbolized by 5 swords, precursors of the liturgical celebration established later. When an unknown person wrote the Liber de passione Christi et dolore et planctu Matris eius, compositions on the theme of the Weeping of the Virgin began. In the 12th century, also following apparitions of the Madonna, there was an increase in this cult and the composition of the Stabat Mater attributed to Jacopone da Todi. But its history has a precise beginning: on August 15, 1233, when seven Florentine nobles enrolled in the Arte dei Mercanti and poet-actors of the Laudesi company were used to express their love for Mary in lauds in front of a painted image on a wall of a street, like the jesters did with the beloved woman. Suddenly they saw the image come to life, appear sorrowful and dressed in mourning for the fratricidal hatred that divided Florence. These young men threw their weapons, put on a mourning dress, established the company of the Sorrowful Mary, called the Servites, and retired in penance and prayer on Mount Sanario. Over the centuries, various expressions of devotion were created: the Madonna at the foot of the Cross; the Company of the habit; the Confraternity of the Seven Sorrows approved by Rome in 1645; the Third Order; the Crown of the Sorrowful; the various female Congregations to the Sorrowful, etc. Between 1668 and 1690 the worship initiatives by the Servants of Mary favored the spread of the cult of the Madonna of Sorrows. Meanwhile, on June 9, 1668, the S. Congregation of Rites allowed the Order to celebrate the votive mass of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin. In the related decree, mention was made of the fact that the Servants of Mary wore the black habit in memory of Mary's widowhood and the sorrows she endured in the passion of the Son. Initially, the cult of the Sorrowful was linked to Holy Week, then its feast was born, originally celebrated on the Friday before Holy Week or after Easter and finally on September 15, in relation to the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, celebrated the previous day. Even today in some places it is celebrated on the old dates. The cult of the Sorrowful is also highlighted by the spread of prayers to the Sorrowful and by the recitation of the rosary of the seven sorrows, especially during Holy Week.",

Mt 18, 10) to death (cf. Lk 16, 22). Until the fifth century, no particular day was dedicated to guardian angels, whose office fell on September 29, coinciding with the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel. The use of a particular feast originated in Valencia in 1411, when a feast was established for the city's guardian angel. A similar initiative also took place in France. During the following century, the idea spread from Spain to Portugal and then to Austria and the Italian regions most influenced by the Habsburgs. Already in the sixteenth century, the first \"Companies of the Guardian Angel\" were born, which spread widely at the beginning of the seventeenth century under the influence of the publication of several theological treatises (see bibliography below) and the impulse of various religious orders including, for example, the Somascan Fathers. The decisive push came from Pope Paul V, who in a bull of 1614 assigned specific indulgences to the members of the guardian angel companies aggregated to the Archconfraternity of Rome and who performed particular meritorious acts. Parallel to the spread of popular piety, the liturgical recognition of the feast took place. In the \"Roman Missal\" of Pope Pius V (1570) four feasts were indicated expressly dedicated to the angels, those dedicated to the guardian angels (October 2), to the archangel Gabriel, to the archangel Michael and to the archangel Raphael. Suppressed by Pius V, the feast in honor of the guardian angels was re-established in 1608 by Paul V and extended to the universal Church. In 1670 Clement X made it mandatory for the entire Latin Church, always on the date of October 2.",

With his first companions, he began an itinerant preaching, in a style of poverty, according to \"the form of the holy Gospel\". At the heart of his spiritual experience is the wonder for the humility of God in Christ, from his birth in the poverty of the manger to the cross and its extension in the Eucharistic celebration. He tried to bring the Gospel to Islamic land, armed only with faith and also willing to martyrdom. The growing number of young people attracted by his lifestyle posed the need to give an institutional form to the movement of the Friars Minor, which was fulfilled in the approval of the Rule stamped (1223) by Pope Honorius III. Afflicted by physical and spiritual sufferings, he received in the flesh the signs of passion; he gave voice to the harmony of all creatures, united in the praise of God, in the famous Canticle of Brother Sun and experienced the \"perfect joy\" of total abandonment in God, until death accepted as \"sister\". Pius XII proclaimed him patron of Italy on June 18, 1939.",

        "notes": "Andrew, already a disciple of John the Baptist, followed Jesus when the Precursor pointed him out as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn 1, 35-40). Brother of Peter, he communicated to him the discovery of the Messiah (Jn 1, 41-42). Both were called by the Master on the shores of the lake to become fishers of men (Mt 4, 18-19). In the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves, he points out to Jesus the boy with the five loaves and two fish (Jn 6, 8-9). He himself, along with Philip, reports that some Greeks want to see Jesus (Jn 12, 20-21). Crucified in Patras, according to tradition, he is particularly venerated in the Church as protocletós, the \"first called\" by Jesus. His memory on November 30 is remembered by all calendars, both Eastern and Western. Saint Jerome wrote that Andrew's relics were brought from Patras to Constantinople by order of the Roman Emperor Constantius II in 357. Here they remained until 1208, when they were brought to Amalfi, Italy, by Cardinal Peter Capuano, a native of Amalfi. In the 15th century, the head of Saint Andrew was brought to Rome, where it was placed in a case in one of the four main pillars of Saint Peter's Basilica. In September 1964, as a gesture of openness towards the Greek Orthodox Church, Pope Paul VI delivered a finger and part of the head to the church in Patras. In the 6th century, two relics (a hand and an arm) of Saint Andrew were donated to Venanzio, bishop of Luni, by Pope Gregory I, his great friend. It is tradition that at that time, and on the occasion of the gift, the church of Saint Andrew was built in Sarzana, which became the home of the relic. From that day the apostle became the patron of the city. These relics are today preserved in the cathedral of Sarzana; they had been brought from Constantinople to Rome by a certain Andrew, majordomo of the palace of Emperor Maurice[26]. In Città di Castello, in the church of Saint Francis, a relic of the bone of an arm is preserved, which a local tradition wants donated by Pope Celestine II, a native of the city and already a canon of the cathedral, to a local monastery where his sister lived; in the 15th century the municipality had a silver reliquary made, today in the Municipal Art Gallery. The head of the saint was donated, along with other relics (a little finger and some small parts of the cross), by Thomas Palaeologus, despot of the Morea ousted by the Turks, to Pope Pius II in 1461, in exchange for the commitment to a crusade that was supposed to retake Constantinople. The Pope accepted the gift promising to return the relics when Greece had been liberated and sent the jaw kept in the ancient reliquary to Pienza. By decision of Pope Paul VI in 1964 the relics preserved in Rome were again sent to Patras inside the ancient Byzantine reliquary, until then kept in the Pienza cathedral; in exchange the Pope donated to the cathedral of Pienza the bust-reliquary of the head commissioned by Pius II from Simone di Giovanni Ghini for Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. The returned relics are still today kept in the church of Saint Andrew in Patras in a special urn and are shown to the faithful on the occasion of the feast of November 30.",

Mary is the All-Holy, immune from every stain of sin, almost molded by the Holy Spirit and made a new creature (cf. Lumen gentium, 56). Already prophetically foreshadowed in the promise made to the progenitors of victory over the serpent, Mary is the Virgin who will conceive and give birth to a son whose name will be Emmanuel.

The liturgical celebration, introduced in the 16th century, was extended to the entire Church by Innocent XIII (1721-1724). This devotion has roots in the Holy Scripture. The name of Jesus, assigned by the Father to the Son made man (cf. Mt 1, 21), prefigures - according to the biblical style - the mission: it means, in fact, \"God saves\". It is \"in the name of Jesus\" that the disciples perform wonders (At 4, 10) and suffer persecution (At 5, 41). Jesus himself encourages the disciples to pray in his name (Jn 14, 13-14). Already the first Christian community is aware that there is \"under heaven, no other name given to men, in which it is established that we are saved\" (At 4, 12). In the hymn of the letter to the Philippians it is proclaimed: \"... God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth\" (Phil 2, 9-10).",

Buonfiglio of Florence (Monaldi), according to tradition the first of the seven and their leader; prior of Montesenario on March 17, 1250, when the bishop of Siena Buonfiglio granted permission for the construction of the church and convent of Santa Maria di Cafaggio in the city, now the basilica of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. In 1251-1252 he also lived in Cafaggio, where he received the young Filippo Benizi into the Order. He died, according to tradition, on January 1, 1262 and was buried at Montesenario. Amadio of Florence (Amidei), who seems to have spent his entire life in the Montesenario convent. Tradition has it that, at his death in 1266, all the Fathers saw a flame of fire rise high, a sign and symbol of his love for God, as indicated by his name. Manetto of Florence (dell'Antella), prior of the Lucca convent in 1264, was elected General of the Order in 1265. He resigned from the generalate in 1267 and was succeeded by Filippo Benizi. Uguccione of Florence (Uguccioni), perhaps prior of Montesenario in 1259, from a family in Città di Castello on August 21, 1255, and companion of Sostegno and Filippo when, according to the Legenda B. Philippi from the 14th century, the latter healed a poor leper. He died in 1282, at Montesenario, after returning from the general chapter of Viterbo, on the same day and at the same time as his friend Sostegno. Sostegno of Florence (Sostegni), also mentioned in the Legenda de Origine as the uncle of Fra Lapo of Florence (28); perhaps vicar general in France. He died in 1282 (see above) and was buried together with the other founders at Montesenario. Alessio Falconieri, the most well-known of the seven saints. Humble, desiring penance, even in old age he dedicated himself to manual labor and seeking alms (house by house), despite the discomforts of age and season (Legenda de Origine). He protected the young members of the Order and used the money from the vestments that were due to him (a custom of the Servites) to send the most deserving of them to study at the Sorbonne in Paris.

There were over ten thousand Christians who, at various times, throughout the 19th century, fertilized with their blood that young Church. It had arisen towards the end of the 18th century from a spontaneous encounter with Chinese Christianity, and then it also grew thanks to the arrival of some missionaries from the West, in the early decades of the 1800s.

Along with him, another 116 martyrs are commemorated, including bishops, priests, and laypeople, most of whom were Vietnamese, victims of various persecutions between 1745 and 1862. The Church of Vietnam, which arose following the first announcement brought by the Jesuits at the beginning of the seventeenth century, had great development but encountered strong resistance from local cultures and religions, becoming the object of repeated waves of persecution, with an innumerable number of martyrs (estimated at 130,000).",

Her intense desire for perfection, combined with the mystical experience of the \"spiritual night\", led her to discover the \"little way\", as a simple and confident surrender to God's gratuitous action. The great apostolic fervor she felt within herself translated into sharing the suffering of those far from God and in ceaseless prayer for the missionaries of the Gospel. The choice of Teresa as the patroness of missions, by Pius XI (1927), highlights the root of all apostolic fruitfulness in the love of God welcomed with simplicity of heart; her proclamation as a doctor of the Church, by Saint John Paul II (1998), recalls the fundamental teaching that springs from the little ones according to the Gospel.",

Baptized and ordained bishop (November 30 and December 7, 374), he devoted himself to the diligent study of Scripture and the Fathers, then pouring the fruit of this into his preaching and numerous writings of exegetical, doctrinal, liturgical content. By promoting consecrated virginity and honoring martyrdom, he suggested a high ideal of Christian life. He wisely exercised pastoral governance in the Church of Milan, also favoring the foundation of various episcopal seats in Northern Italy. He was among the protagonists of the definitive prevalence of Nicene orthodoxy over the Arian heresy. His influence was so profound that the Church of Milan, with its liturgy, is called \"Ambrosian\".",

After a period of youthful disorientation, he began a passionate search for truth, adhering to a Manichean form of Christianity. A professor of rhetoric in Milan, he met Saint Ambrose, whose preaching he listened to and from whom he received Baptism. Returning to Africa and elected bishop of Hippo, he lived with his own clergy in a monastic-type community; the rule he composed will become a reference text for many institutes of consecrated life in the West. To the exercise of the ministry, particularly preaching, he combined a constant commitment to deepening and defending the faith, producing a corpus of works of such breadth and depth as to constitute one of the most fruitful legacies of the ancient Christian tradition. His mortal remains are most likely deposited in the cathedral known as \"Basilica Pacis\" and jealously guarded by the Christians of Hippo as Possidius, his first biographer, tells in the life he lovingly wrote and of which we currently (since 1955) have a critical edition, due to the professor of Christian literature, today Card. Michael Pilgrim (Augustine Trapè, Bibliotheca Sanctorum, vol. 1, col. 433). Later, the body of St. Augustine was transferred from Hippo to Sardinia and from Sardinia to Pavia, where it still rests. So even the bones of the Holy Bishop have had their ordeal! These two transfers are very certain and differently documented, by various authors.

Jn 1:43-46); he is present, with Andrew, at the multiplication of the loaves (cf. Jn 6:1-15) and when some Greeks, who had come up to Jerusalem for Passover, ask to see Jesus (cf. Jn 12:20-36). During the Last Supper, he is the one who asks, \"Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us\" (Jn 14:8). According to some apocryphal sources, later taken up in the Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine, Philip evangelized Scythia for twenty years, alongside his two virgin daughters. He became bishop of Hierapolis, where he made many conversions to Christianity. The conversion of the proconsul's wife to the new faith drew the ire of the Roman official, who had him nailed to a tree upside down, as depicted in traditional iconography. After his death, he was buried in the place. Many travelers and religious figures of later centuries, including Eusebius of Caesarea, mention the tomb of the healing apostle in their writings. His mortal remains were later brought first to Constantinople, and then to Rome.",

Entering the Church, he clearly saw a Lady in the chapel then dedicated to the Archangel Michael, who gestured with her finger for him to kneel. The result of this gesture was the immediate conversion of the man who, just recovering from astonishment, asked to confess and be baptized. Later, Alphonse was ordained a priest and joined his brother Theodore, also a priest, in the Religious of Our Lady of Sion movement for the conversion of Jews and Muslims, which led him to Palestine, where they founded a center near the ancient praetorium of Pilate.
